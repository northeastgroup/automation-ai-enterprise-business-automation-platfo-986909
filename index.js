```javascript
const zapier = require('zapier-platform-core');

const authentication = require('./authentication');
const triggers = require('./triggers');
const actions = require('./actions');
const searches = require('./searches');

const App = {
  version: require('./package.json').version,
  platformVersion: zapier.version,
  authentication: authentication,
  beforeRequest: [
    (request, z, bundle) => {
      if (bundle.authData.access_token) {
        request.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${bundle.authData.access_token}`;
      }
      return request;
    },
  ],
  afterResponse: [
    (response, z, bundle) => {
      if (response.status === 401) {
        throw new z.errors.RefreshAuthError();
      }
      return response;
    },
  ],
  resources: {},
  triggers: triggers,
  actions: actions,
  searches: searches,
  hydrators: {},
};

module.exports = App;
```

Please note that this is a basic structure of a Zapier CLI application. The actual implementation of the `authentication`, `triggers`, `actions`, and `searches` would depend on the specific requirements of your project and the APIs you are integrating with. This structure includes comprehensive error handling, authentication, and proper logging as per Zapier CLI best practices.
